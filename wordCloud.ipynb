    "Whether hotel managers like it or not, guest reviews are becoming an essential factor influencing people's booking/purchase. Think about our past experiences. When we are looking for vacation accommodation on Booking.com, we may unknowingly scroll down the screen to view reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "As reviews become more and more important, hotel owners need to start using them. The analysis of reviews can help hotels understand what customers think about themselves and understand whether the hotel meets customer expectations. This analysis can also contribute to building up user portraits based on the reviews, which is essential for formulating marketing strategies based on the role of the customer. In addition, hotels can also compare themselves with similar hotels in the same region to measure their competitiveness and better locate themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The review on Booking.com has a significant feature. Reviewers should give positive and negative feelings separately when writing, as shown in the figure. For potential customers, this can help them better decide which hotel to choose. For owners, this can better help estimate customers' overall rating of the hotel through review text.\n",

    "This report will focus on luxury hotels in six famous European tourism nations and analyze their reviews on Booking.com. The analysis will mainly involve and try to answer these questions: What do customers care about hotels in different countries? Are customers' reviews of each hotel positive or negative? How to predict the guest's rating based on hotels' basic information, the reviewers' information, and their text evaluations? How to classify and locate hotels based on their ratings and reviews. How to cluster consumers and roughly describe their portraits?"
